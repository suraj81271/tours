It was planned to design in Pink color, as the color signs for hospitality. The city is known to give an unending experience to the tourist as well as the localities.Pink city has its own vibes and flavors which blends to perfection and brings a completely different exposure. Jaipur is all about forts, museums, food, monuments, shopping and many more things. As a tourist or a newbie in the city, it is always considered to explore the city as a local but in the end, it becomes too messy.The moment you arrive in Jaipur you will witness that the walls of most building are painted in “pink” terracotta color. The color resembles the city’s heritage and culture. Going back in the history, when Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh was in power and when Prince Albert came to Jaipur during the India tour in 1876. Maharaja wanted to impress the Prince and hence, he planned an extreme strategy.Pink city has its own vibes and flavors which blends to perfection and brings a completely different exposure.

It is simply one of the most stunning monuments ever built. It is built completely of semi-translucent white marble and took 22 years for completion. You will see why it took this long when you notice the details of the marvelous, grand structure with an open mouth and an amazed heart.The Taj Mahal has been showcased in several movies in India and in Hollywood. The beauty of the Taj Mahal adds so much to every frame that you cannot help but wonder what it would be like to be there. Watching your favorite stars dancing or strolling around the Taj Mahal adds to its glamour quotient.The Taj Mahal has been part of several lists of important places in the world – the seven wonders being one of them.

Usually, a pilgrimage to Tungnath is undertaken as part of the Panch Kedar (five temples dedicated to Lord Shiva in Uttarakhand) trek covering the five temples of Kedarnath, Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheswar and Kalpeshwar. The 170km trek route starts from Rishikesh.However, if you just want to explore Tungnath exclusively, the best way to reach here is after a 4km trek from Chopta. It’s an incredibly beautiful trek; the stone paved trekking path is fitted with proper benches to provide extra comfort to the trekkers.
